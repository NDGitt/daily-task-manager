3. Go to Application tab > Manifest to verify PWA configuration
4. Check Service Workers tab to see if service worker is registered

### 2. Install Testing

2. Look for the install prompt (usually appears in address bar or as a banner)
3. Click "Install" to add to home screen
4. The app should now appear as a standalone app

## Icon Requirements

Your app icon (`app-icon.png`) should ideally be:
